# Production Security Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive security checklist for deploying the Admin Backend API to production.

## ‚úÖ Critical Security Requirements

### 1. Environment Configuration

- [ ] **NODE_ENV** set to `production`
- [ ] **JWT_SECRET** is a cryptographically strong random string (64+ bytes)
  - Generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"`
  - Never use example/default values
  - Store securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- [ ] **MONGO_URI** uses authentication and encryption
  - Format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@...`
  - Use strong database passwords
  - Enable IP whitelisting
- [ ] **CORS_ORIGIN** contains only specific domains
  - ‚ùå Never use `*` in production
  - ‚úÖ Use: `https://yourdomain.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com`
- [ ] **FASTAPI_BOT_URL** points to production bot service
  - Use HTTPS in production
  - Verify service is accessible and secured

### 2. Database Security

- [ ] MongoDB authentication enabled
- [ ] Database user has minimal required permissions
  - Create application-specific user
  - Grant only necessary database/collection access
- [ ] Connection string uses SSL/TLS (`ssl=true`)
- [ ] IP whitelist configured (only allow backend servers)
- [ ] Regular automated backups configured
- [ ] Backup restoration tested
- [ ] Database monitoring enabled
- [ ] Connection pooling configured appropriately

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Password hashing uses bcrypt with sufficient salt rounds (10-12)
- [ ] JWT tokens have reasonable expiration (1 day or less)
- [ ] Token algorithm explicitly set to HS256
- [ ] Bearer token format enforced
- [ ] Authentication errors don't leak information
  - Same error for "user not found" and "wrong password"
- [ ] Consider implementing refresh tokens for extended sessions
- [ ] Consider implementing JWT blacklist for logout

### 4. Rate Limiting

- [ ] Rate limiting enabled on all routes
- [ ] Strict limits on authentication endpoints:
  - Login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Registration: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- [ ] Moderate limits on bot endpoints (10 per minute)
- [ ] General API rate limit (100 per 15 minutes)
- [ ] Rate limiting persists across server restarts (use Redis for distributed)

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization

- [ ] All user inputs validated before processing
- [ ] Email format validation
- [ ] Username pattern validation (alphanumeric + underscore)
- [ ] Password strength requirements enforced
- [ ] Input length limits enforced
- [ ] HTML/script injection prevention
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (mongoose handles this)
- [ ] Request body size limits enforced (10mb default)

### 6. Error Handling & Logging

- [ ] Stack traces disabled in production
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal details
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged (passwords, tokens, PII)
- [ ] Structured logging implemented
- [ ] Log aggregation service configured (e.g., ELK, Splunk)
- [ ] Error monitoring service configured (e.g., Sentry)

### 7. HTTPS & Transport Security

- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enabled (SSL certificate installed)
- [ ] HTTP redirects to HTTPS
- [ ] HSTS header enabled (Strict-Transport-Security)

- [ ] Secure ciphers only

### 8. Security Headers (Helmet.js)

- [ ] Helmet.js middleware enabled
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy configured
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection enabled
- [ ] Referrer-Policy configured
- [ ] Permissions-Policy configured

### 9. API Security

- [ ] CORS configured with specific origins only
- [ ] Authentication required on all protected endpoints
- [ ] Authorization checks implemented (if role-based)
- [ ] No sensitive data in URLs/query parameters
- [ ] API versioning implemented (e.g., /api/v1/)
- [ ] Request throttling for expensive operations
- [ ] Pagination for list endpoints

### 10. Dependency Security

- [ ] All dependencies updated to latest stable versions
- [ ] `npm audit` shows no vulnerabilities
  - Run: `npm audit`
  - Fix: `npm audit fix`
- [ ] Automated dependency updates configured (e.g., Dependabot)
- [ ] Regular security patches applied
- [ ] Unused dependencies removed
- [ ] Lock file committed (package-lock.json)

## üîç Additional Security Measures

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] Firewall configured to allow only necessary ports
- [ ] Server OS patched and updated
- [ ] SSH key-based authentication (disable password auth)

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Commands

### Check for vulnerabilities
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

### Generate secure JWT secret
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

### Test SSL/TLS configuration
```bash
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443
```

### Check security headers
```bash
curl -I https://yourdomain.com
```
